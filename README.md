# eval_ex

A Dart port of https://github.com/uklimaschewski/EvalEx.  
EvalEx supports mathematical and boolean expression evaluation, using arbitrary precision.
EvalEx supports functions, variables, and operators and additionally makes it very easy to
add your own custom functions or operators.

EvalEx uses [decimal](https://pub.dev/packages/decimal) to support arbitrary precision arithmetic.  
View package on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/eval_ex).

## Basic example

```dart
void main() {
  Expression exp = Expression("2 ^ 4 + 8");
  print(exp.eval().toString()); // 24

  // With a variable
  exp = Expression("a ^ b + c");
  // Variables may contain alphanumeric characters, and "_". This can be changed
  // by using setVariableCharacters(..) and setFirstVariableCharacters(..) (what chars variable are allowed to start with).
  exp.setStringVariable("a", "2");
  exp.setStringVariable("b", "4");
  exp.setStringVariable("c", "8");
  print(exp.eval().toString()); // 24
  
  // With a function
  exp = Expression("MAX(-7,8)");
  print(exp.eval().toString()); // 8

  // Boolean logic
  exp = Expression("1>0 && 5 == 5");
  print(exp.eval().toString()); // 1
  
  exp = Expression("1>0 && 5 == 4");
  print(exp.eval().toString()); // 0
}
 
```

## Adding custom functions, operators, and variables
Custom functions, operators, and variables can be defined by adding them in built_ins.dart

## Differences from https://github.com/uklimaschewski/EvalEx.
  - Hyperbolic functions aren't supported
  - The SQRT function is currently limited to 64-bit precision
  - Built in operators/functions/variables are instead defined in built_ins.dart
